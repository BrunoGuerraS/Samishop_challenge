# Reto Tecnico Samishop
## Let's start
This page has been created as part of a technical challenge to demonstrate how to consume data from the Star Wars API and display it in an interactive format. The Star Wars API provides information about characters, and more from the famous saga.

On this page, you can explore the list of Star Wars characters, view details of each character, and discover fascinating information about their homeworld, species, and other characteristics. Additionally, the page features infinite scroll functionality, allowing you to load more characters as you scroll down.

This project has been developed using technologies like React and Next.js, enabling a smooth and responsive experience tailored for both mobile devices and desktop screens. CSS has also been utilized to style the page and make it visually appealing.

Feel free to explore, learn, and enjoy the experience of immersing yourself in the captivating universe of Star Wars through this small application.

May the Force be with you on your journey through the galaxy!
